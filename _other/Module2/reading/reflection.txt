PHP is a very versatile language that provides a strong backbone for front-end development. I knew PHP at a high level, so exploring it in depth was helpful to see its full power. As a loosely typed language, it can help with development especially when it comes to numbers where it automatically widens when numbers overflow. Arrays, associative arrays, and strings are well thought out with many member functions and attributes that allow them to be very useful. For instance, each loop allows for so much power with arrays and associative arrays especially since it can unpack the values into its key and value form. That being, the way that arrays are implemented would likely allow for traversing databases to be easier. The topics so far seem to make sense and I am looking forward to trying to implement them in the future.
